Scala Made Easy

Model a user and functionality for a portal called ScalaMadeEasy.com (of course it is fictional)

A User visiting this website can

Subscribe to the weekly newsletter (with an email address)

Un-subscribe from the weekly newsletter
Register as a student. (we need their email address and a password; the system must allocate a UUID to this user)
Unregister from the site (we remove everything we have about this user from our system. GDPR strikes!)

a registered user can take lessons
a user who has finished 10 lessons is a certified Scala expert (yeah, sure!)

Whatâ€™s expected?

Simple object modelling. No frameworks, no REST API, no DB.
No mutation. i.e. No vars, no mutable data structures.
No command line interface needed. Tests are your consumers. Tests with test framework of your choice (eg: ScalaTest).
Bonus points for covering edge cases, e.g. a non-registered user should not be able to take a lesson.

P.S.: the project is just a skeleton to help you to start coding faster, do whatever you want with the configuration.
